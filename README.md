Conditional branching

Tasks:
 1.If the variable a is equal to zero, then print 'True', otherwise print 'False'.
 
 2.If the variable a is greater than zero, then print 'True', otherwise print 'False'.
 
 3.If the variable a is less than zero, then print ‘True’, otherwise print ‘False’.
 
 4.If the variable a is greater than or equal to zero, then print ‘True’, otherwise print ‘False’.
 
 5.If the variable a is less than or equal to zero, then print ‘True’, otherwise print ‘False’.
 
 6.If the variable a is not equal to zero, then print ‘True’, otherwise print ‘False’.
 
 7.If the variable a is equal to 'test', then print 'True', otherwise print 'False'.
 
 8.If the variable a is equal to '1' both by value and by type, then print 'True', otherwise print 'False'.
 
 9.If the variable a is greater than zero and less than 5, then print ‘True’, otherwise print ‘False’.
 
 10.If the variable a is equal to zero or equal to two, then add 7 to it, otherwise divide it by 10. Print the new value of the variable on the screen.
 
 11.If variable a is equal to or less than 1, and variable b is greater than or equal to 3, then print the sum of these variables, otherwise print their difference (the result of the subtraction).
 
 12.If variable a is greater than 2 and less than 11, or variable b is greater than or equal to 6 and less than 14, then print ‘True’, otherwise print ‘False’.
 
 13.The num variable can take 4 values: 1, 2, 3 or 4. If it has the value '1', then we will write 'winter' into the result variable, if it has the value '2' - 'spring' and so on. Solve the problem through switch-case.
